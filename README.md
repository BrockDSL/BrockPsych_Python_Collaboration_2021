 # DSL / Brock Psychology Society Fall 2021 Workshop Series


## The Series



The Brock [DSL](https://brocku.ca/library/dsl) and the [Brock Psychology Society](https://brocku.ca/social-sciences/psychology/resources/brock-psychology-society/) organizations started a partnership to provide focused hands on tutorials that taught real on the ground skills in the topics of digital scholarship and data science. For the fall of 2021 this partnership will be a four part workshop outlined below.





## The Data Set



The dataset used for this workshop series can be found on the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository]


## Workshop Sessions


### Session 1: Introduction to Python

**To be announced (online)**  

This session will provide you with the very basics of how to read and write Python code. We'll be using the Google Collab environment to learn so no extra software installation will be required. By the end of the sessions you'll be comfortable with the basics of Python which includes: variables, conditionals, loops, and writing function.

### Session 2: Python and Data Science in Psychology

**To be announced (online)**

Part 2 will build on what was started in part 1. This time we'll expand our understanding of how Python works by introducing the Pandas Library, and will focus on how one can peform some analysis on our data using Python. This will include some fairly complex statistical analysis and also graphing some visualizations using the MatPlotLib and Seaborn Libraries.

### Session 3: Python and Website Building

**To be announced (online)**

Part 3 will focus on building a website that recieves input from users and gives them output using PythonAnywhere. We will create an online MBTI quiz that tells users which of the 16 personalities they are. We will then learn how to extract user data from this website into an organized data table in Python (web scraping)

### Session 4: Using Python to create Psychology experiments

**To be announced (online)**
In the fourth and final session we will explore how to use Python's Psychopy library to create a psychology experiment
