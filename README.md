 # DSL / Brock Psychology Society Fall 2021 Workshop Series


## The Series



The Brock [DSL](https://brocku.ca/library/dsl) and the [Brock Psychology Society](https://brocku.ca/social-sciences/psychology/resources/brock-psychology-society/) organizations started a partnership to provide focused hands on tutorials that taught real on the ground skills in the topics of digital scholarship and data science. For the fall of 2021 this partnership will be a four part workshop outlined below.





## The Data Set



The dataset used for this workshop series can be found on the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository]


## Workshop Sessions


### Session 1: Introduction to Python

**To be announced (online via [Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86316927632?pwd=c2tVYmR4VDRWTlZSZnVZeDN3cmdLZz09))**  

This session will provide you with the very basics of how to read and write Python code. We'll be using the Google Collab environment to learn so no extra software installation will be required. By the end of the sessions you'll be comfortable with the basics of Python which includes: variables, conditionals, loops, and writing function.

### Session 2: Python and Accessing Data

**To be announced (online via [Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85847146113?pwd=WEdBZi8yY0dOTzRiNFFsYks2U0JBUT09))**

Part 2 will build on what was started in part 1. This time we'll expand our understanding of how Python works by introducing the Pandas Library

### Session 3: Python Techniques for Data Science

**To be announced (online via [Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85153756750?pwd=RmFiaGxtQnprTEFISXdoSXdWZERqZz09))**

Part 3 will focus on how can peform some analysis on our data using Python. This will include some fairly complex statistical analysis and also graphing some visualizations using the MatPlotLib Library.

### Session 4: Machine Learning with Python

**To be announced (online via [Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81973732112?pwd=Tm8rcFh3S2pWSXFtcFlrc1FRclhiUT09))**
In the fourth and final session we will bring together everything we have learning into an investigation of machine learning and artificial intelligence. We'll build a model that will allow us to make sure predictions about our data and to draw some generalizations about the trends we find in it. We will explore how to use Python's Psychopy library to create a psychology experiment
